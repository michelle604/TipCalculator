# Tip Calculator 

## *Michelle Chia-Jui Hung*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Custom colors palette selected
* [x] Custom font and the tip description

## Notes

It was particularly new for me to learn how to add a bar with color and description changing while scrolling it right and left. I had some trouble implementing it myself.
